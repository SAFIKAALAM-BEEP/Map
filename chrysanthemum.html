        <h1>Chrysanthemum</h1>

        <p>The textbook was a dense, academic shield in my hands, its pages a taxonomy of color and form. Rosa. Tulipa.
            Lilium. I fired the Latin names like arrows, and my friend, slumped over the table in a pre-Olympiad stupor,
            batted them back with the weary precision of a seasoned botanist. "Rosaceae... woody perennial... typically
            five petals." The words were a rhythmic, almost hypnotic chant. In the quiet of the library, we were
            building a fortress of facts.</p>

        <p>Then, the siege of studying paused. He looked up, his eyes refocusing from the internal flashcards to me. "Do
            you have a favorite flower?" he asked, his voice cutting through the clinical silence.</p>

        <p>The question felt disarmingly personal. "Chrysanthemums," I said, the word feeling a little soft and poetic,
            a stark contrast to the sharp-edged Latin.</p>

        <p>He didn't smile or offer a simple "cool." Instead, his eyes glazed over, his mind accessing a different file.
            "Ah," he said, the sound a soft click of recognition. "Chrysanthemum morifolium. Family Asteraceae.
            Herbaceous perennial." He was looking at me, but I could tell he was seeing the entry in his mental
            textbook. "The name derives from the Greek chrysos, meaning 'gold,' and anthemon, meaning 'flower.'" A brief
            pause, then another layer. "They're short-day plants. Photoperiodic. They need long nights to trigger
            blooming."</p>

        <p>I was stunned. I fumbled with the heavy book, my fingers skimming the index until I found the page. There it
            was, his recitation rendered in black and white: the species name, the family, the etymology. "You're
            right," I breathed out, a laugh of pure wonder escaping. "That's... super cool."</p>

        <p>It was my turn. I felt the need to offer a token from my own world, a territory not of cellular structures
            and taxonomies, but of meaning and metaphor. "They mean loyalty," I said, my voice softer now. "And devoted
            love. But it changes. In some places, they're for honesty. And in others... they're for death. For graves."
        </p>

        <p>He didn't dismiss it as sentimental fluff. He absorbed this new data with the same quiet intensity, his brow
            furrowed slightly as he processed the paradox: flower of the living and the dead, of joy and grief, all
            contained within the same biological structure he had just defined.</p>

        <p>For a suspended moment, the barrier between our two worlds dissolved. His science did not explain away my
            symbolism, and my symbolism did not romanticize his science. Instead, they intertwined, each giving the
            other depth and a strange, new resonance. He had given the chrysanthemum its body, its facts and functions.
            And I, in return, had given it a soul.</p>

        <h2>The Snowman</h2>

        <p>The world had turned to a blur of white, the snow falling so thickly it felt like we were inside a shaken
            snow globe. It was hella cold, but we were on a mission. On the field outside our school, we balled up snow
            with bare, stinging hands, packing it into the best spheres we could manage. The result was a little
            pathetic: a small, lopsided snowman, barely two feet tall, looking naked and vaguely apologetic.</p>

        <p>"It's missing something," someone said, stating the obvious.</p>

        <p>A scavenger hunt began. One friend returned from the treeline, triumphantly holding two small, gnarled
            sticks. "Now it has arms!" Another scooped up a handful of dark pebbles from the cleared path, pressing them
            into the snowman's torso. "Now it has clothes!" A third carefully carved a lopsided smiley face. "And now a
            face!"</p>

        <p>It was complete, yet it wasn't. I reached into my backpack, past textbooks and binders, and pulled out a
            single orange post-it note. I folded it again and again, creasing it with my numb fingers until it formed a
            tiny, pointed hat. I placed it carefully on the snowman's head.</p>

        <p>"Now," I said, "he won't be cold."</p>

        <h2>Romeo & Juliet & the Wall</h2>

        <p>It was, objectively, the worst possible day for it. The sky was a sheet of bruised grey, and a cold,
            insistent rain fell, turning the world into a watercolor of misery. The kind of damp that seeps through
            jackets and settles in your bones, making even the simplest movement feel like a chore. But the drama
            project was due, a significant chunk of our grade, and my absurd script demanded to be performed. My
            friends, glorious, chaotic idiots that they are, had agreed to be my actors without a second's hesitation.
            There was no question of postponement. The show, against all reason and meteorology, must go on.</p>

        <p>We took over a covered, garden-wedding pagoda in the park next to the school, its tin roof drumming a
            frantic, percussive accompaniment to our scene. The air was thick with the smell of wet earth and cheap
            hairspray. Our Romeo had safety pins stapled to his jacket and wielded a cardboard guitar spray-painted
            silver. Our Juliet was a vision of disintegrating aristocracy, her towering wig made of paper towels and
            wire, already beginning to sag under the humidity.</p>

        <p>The central twist of my "brilliant" adaptation was that our star-crossed lovers both possessed the IQs of
            particularly dense kindergartners. They could hear each other's voices through the lush, imaginary garden
            wall but were convinced the other was the wall itself, a sentient, talking wall. The entire tragic plot was
            inverted: they weren't trying to tear the wall down; they were fighting to keep it, each desperately in love
            with the brick and mortar they believed the other to be.</p>

        <p>The dialogue was pure, unadulterated chaos.</p>

        <p>Juliet swooned, clutching her chest, her voice a dramatic, high-pitched warble: "Oh, wondrous wall! Your
            voice is like gravel and sunshine! Tell me again of the rude pressures of the world beyond!"</p>

        <p>Romeo yelled back, strumming a discordant note on his cardboard guitar. "Shut up, you fancy pile of rocks!
            You're interrupting the wall's beautiful song! It's singing a punk anthem for the disenfranchised masonry of
            the world!"</p>

        <p>I stood shivering to the side, shouting stage directions over the rain. "Now, Juliet, press your ear against
            the wall with passionate confusion!" Sarah, with complete commitment, smushed her face against the damp
            cardboard, leaving a smudge of foundation.</p>

        <p>The "fight scene" was a masterpiece of idiocy. When our Paris analogue tried to "repair" the wall with a roll
            of duct tape, both Romeo and Juliet turned on him.</p>

        <p>"Unhand my beloved partition!" Romeo shrieked, waving his guitar.</p>

        <p>"You shall not silence my stony sweetheart!" Juliet cried, hitting him with her paper fan.</p>

        <p>We were all shivering, our hands turning raw and red with cold, our shoes soaked through. With every
            ridiculous line delivered with Shakespearean gravity, with every piece of a costume falling apart, we
            doubled over, breathless and crying with laughter. It was the dumbest idea ever conceived. But the rain on
            the tin roof was our applause, the grey sky our theatre.</p>

        <h2>The Locked Kitchen</h2>

        <p>The air in the clubroom grew thick with the scent of dry-erase markers and concentrated thought. We were a
            single mind, fractured into a dozen perspectives, all focused on the ghost of Robin Barnes.</p>

        <p>"Let's walk through it again," someone said, their marker squeaking as they drew a rough floor plan of the
            kitchen on the whiteboard. "The husband leaves at 4:00 PM. He returns at 5:30 PM. That's a ninety-minute
            window."</p>

        <p>Another voice cut in, "And he claims the kitchen door was propped open when he left, but locked when he
            returned. That's our first variable. Did he lie, or did someone else lock it?"</p>

        <p>We turned our attention to the body, a phantom lying on the cold linoleum in our collective imagination.</p>

        <p>"The ice cube tray is the key," insisted a member from the corner, tapping their copy of the case file. "If
            the body was next to the open refrigerator, the ambient heat would have started melting the ice. The Medical
            Examiner could have used the temperature of the refrigerator contents and the state of the ice to get a much
            more precise time of death. Was it closer to 4:15 or 5:15? That tells us if the husband's timeline is even
            possible."</p>

        <p>"But the stove!" another countered, leaning forward. "All the gas jets are on. She's asphyxiated. That's a
            clear cause of death. Case closedâ€”suicide."</p>

        <p>A scoff came from the other side of the table. "And she just decided to do it in the middle of peeling
            potatoes? With a pie fresh from the oven? That's not a suicide; that's a chaotic dinner party. You don't
            start making a pie and peeling potatoes if you plan to be dead in an hour. The interrupted action is a huge
            red flag."</p>

        <p>The room buzzed with agreement. The scene was too busy, too domestic, for such a final, quiet act.</p>

        <p>"Then let's talk about the weapon," a quieter voice suggested. "The report mentions a possible blunt trauma
            to the head. What could have caused it? The rolling pin on the butcher block, covered in flour? Or the iron,
            still hot on the board? If it was the iron, that suggests premeditation. You don't accidentally hit someone
            with a hot iron during a struggle."</p>

        <p>My own eyes were fixed on the evidence list. "The window," I said, and the room quieted. "The pin is out.
            Someone could have opened it, climbed out, and pulled it shut from the outside. It's a classic locked-room
            mystery trope. But that doesn't explain the doors."</p>

        <p>"The doors are the real puzzle," the leader at the whiteboard agreed, circling the two entrances. "Both
            locked from the inside. And the edges are stuffed with newspaper. Why? To seal the room? To keep the gas in?
            But if it was suicide, why would she bother? And if it was murder, how did the killer get out?"</p>

        <p>A theory began to form, fragile and complex. "What if it was the husband?" someone ventured. "What if he
            never went downtown? He stages the scene. He turns on the gas, maybe knocks her out with the iron first. He
            stuffs the newspaper in the doors before he locks them, creating a seal. Then he climbs out the window,
            leaving it locked but without the pin, and goes to establish his alibi. He returns, 'finds' the body, and
            calls the police. The locked doors and the gas jets make it look like a suicide, but the interrupted
            potatoes and the misplaced iron suggest a struggle."</p>

        <p>"But the pie," another member countered, playing devil's advocate. "The pie was just out of the oven. If he
            did it before he left, the pie would have been cold or burned by 5:30. The timeline is too tight."</p>

        <p>We sat in silence for a moment, the pieces refusing to snap into place. The ghost of Robin Barnes was
            guarding her secrets. We had the stove, the sink, the window, and the doors. We had a rolling pin and a hot
            iron. But the truth remained just out of reach, locked in that kitchen with her.</p>

        <p>"Alright," the leader finally said, capping the marker. "We're missing something. Let's go through the
            evidence one more time. Start with the butcher block. The glass and the rolling pin. Why are they there?"
