        <h1>My World</h1>

        <p>The wagon jolted violently, its wooden wheels finding every single rut and stone on the Triboar Trail.
            Inside, the atmosphere was as thick and awkward as the dust motes dancing in the late afternoon sun.</p>

        <p>Nomu, the drow paladin, sat in rigid silence, their polished black plate armor a stark contrast to the
            rough-hewn wagon bed. Every jostle was a personal insult to their noble upbringing. Their mind drifted from
            the muddy path to the cold, precise architecture of Northdark, to the disappointed eyes of their parents.
            This quest to find some missing dwarven prospectors was to be their first step toward a destiny of their own
            making, a chance to prove themself outside the rigid gender politics of House Wenrud. It was supposed to be
            glorious, not this rustic indignity.</p>

        <p>Hours prior, at the Stonehill Tavern in Phandalin, Nomu, feeling profoundly out of place, was approached by a
            frantic dwarf, Gundren Rockseeker. Before terms could be discussed, Nomu felt a subtle tug at their coin
            purse. They spun, their gauntleted hand closing around the wrist of a small, blue-eyed tabaxi whose fingers
            were inches from their gold. "Explain yourself," Nomu had hissed, their voice low and dangerous.</p>

        <p>The tabaxi, Clouds in the Water, merely blinked his sky blue eyes, utterly unrepentant. "You looked heavy. I
            was lightening your load." It was then that Gundren, seeing two capable-looking adventurers, interrupted
            with his offer of gold. Clouds's ears perked up at the word. Money. It was a temporary concept to acquire
            shinies and pay debts, and he needed companions for the job. "He is with me," Clouds had declared, pointing
            a clawed thumb at the bewildered Nomu.</p>

        <p>On the other side of the bar, a very small, very frustrated half-dragonborn, half-tabaxi was standing on a
            stool, arguing with the bartender. "My age is a social construct!" Fluffy, or Kerrhylon Rhogar, squeaked,
            his white scales and snow-leopard fur fluffed in indignation. "I can hold my ale! My father said I have the
            liver of a very robust goat!" He was clutching his mother's lute case like a lifeline. The barkeep had been
            unmoved, but the promise of a real adventure, of a story to tell and a song to write, was all it took for
            him to join their motley crew.</p>

        <p>Back in the wagon, Fluffy was trying to tune his lute against the bumpy rhythm. Clouds was meticulously
            polishing a piece of seaglass he had found near the tavern, his eyes distant, humming a low, mournful tune,
            a fragment of his clan's oral history, a thread connecting him to a mother and a home swallowed by desert
            sands.</p>

        <p>I leaned forward, my voice dropping into a narrator's cadence. "The wagon rounds a bend in the trail. Ahead,
            you see a pair of horses lying in the middle of the path, their bodies pierced with black-fletched arrows."
        </p>

        <p>The wagon screeched to a halt. The trio peered out.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "An ambush. Stay sharp," Nomu whispered, drawing their longsword with a metallic whisper.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "Any chance they're sleeping?" Fluffy asked, his voice tinged with genuine concern.
        </blockquote>

        <p>I could not help but smirk. "They are very, very not sleeping. Everyone, give me a Perception check."</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Perception Check: 5 from Nomu, too focused on the obvious threat. 3 from Fluffy, who was more concerned
            with the well-being of the 'sleeping' horses. 7 from Clouds, who was wondering if the horses' bridles had
            any shiny bits on them."
        </blockquote>

        <p>"Yeah, you are all completely surprised. Roll for initiative."</p>

        <p>What followed was a symphony of catastrophic failure. Goblin arrows rained down from the thicket. Nomu, in
            their heavy armor, moved with the grace of a constipated owlbear, their sword whistling through empty air.
        </p>

        <p>I picked up my own dice, feeling a familiar, mischievous energy. "The goblin snickers and looses an arrow at
            the heavily armored target..." I rolled. The die came to a stop. A slow grin spread across my face.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Natural 20. To hit. And that is 8 piercing damage, Nomu. It finds a gap in your pauldron."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "What the fuck?" Nomu's player shouted, staring at their character sheet in dismay.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Fluffy fumbled for his crossbow, the bolt firing wildly and getting lodged in the wagon's side. Clouds, with
            a feral yell, leaped into the fray, only to trip over a root and land face first in the mud.</p>

        <p>I rolled again for the goblin targeting Fluffy. The die tumbled, landed, and revealed another 20. The table
            erupted in disbelief.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Another natural 20? Fluffy, you take 6 damage. You are looking real rough, little guy."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Somehow, through a combination of sheer, undeserved luck and the goblins' own overconfidence, they survived.
            Nomu landed one solid blow, Fluffy inspired a faint "Bardic Inspiration" that mostly just confused everyone,
            and Clouds managed to tackle one goblin, scaring the other two into fleeing into the woods.</p>

        <p>Panting, bleeding, and humbly defeated, they watched the last goblin escape.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "We follow," Clouds's player stated, their voice flat. "Their den will have loot."
        </blockquote>

        <p>But before they could take a step, Nomu's player held up a hand. "Wait. Our efficiency was lacking. Our
            movements were sluggish. We must calculate our loads to avoid being encumbered."</p>

        <p>I leaned back in my chair, taking a long sip of my drink as I watched the descent into madness. What followed
            was a solid hour of pure, unadulterated logistics that tested my patience as much as their sanity.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Okay, so my lute is 2 pounds," Fluffy's player muttered, scribbling on a notepad. "My crossbow is 5. My
            rations are 8 but if I eat two now, that is 6. Does the weight of the amulet my dad gave me count? It is
            mostly emotional baggage."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "My plate armor is 65 pounds," Nomu's player recited, their tone funereal. "My longsword is 3. My sense of
            impending familial disappointment is immeasurable."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I have 50 feet of rope," Clouds's player added, without looking up. "And this shiny rock. And this other
            shiny rock. And the 15 gold pieces we got from the dwarf. I do not want them; they are heavy. I will buy
            something shiny later."
        </blockquote>

        <p>They argued. They ate rations on the spot to lighten the load. They nearly came to blows over the carrying
            capacity of a backpack. Finally, stripped of all but the "essentials" which, for Clouds, included several
            non-valuable but shiny stones, they set off, following the clumsy trail left by the panicked goblins.</p>

        <p>It led them to a well-concealed cave mouth, hidden behind a thicket near a stream. The air from within was
            damp and carried the smell of damp fur and rotting meat. They shared a look, a look that now held the shared
            trauma of near-death and an hour of mathematical hell.</p>

        <p>"You peer into the dark, narrow cave entrance," I described. "The stream flows out, and you can hear faint,
            guttural voices echoing from within. What do you do?"</p>

        <blockquote>
            "We advance. Quietly," Nomu's player said.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I can try to play a soothing melody to lull them into a false sense of security?" Fluffy's player offered.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "No," Clouds's player said, a sudden, unnerving smirk on their face. "I have a better idea."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Before anyone could stop them, they declared that Clouds in the Water, the supposed introverted, ineloquent
            barbarian, sauntered right up to the cave entrance.</p>

        <p>In the story, Clouds cleared his throat and called out in a surprisingly clear voice.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Hello? Ugly little green goblin? We wish to speak to your manager."
        </blockquote>

        <p>A moment later, a goblin, slightly larger and more cunning-looking than the others, peered out. This was
            Yeemik.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Who you? What you want?" Yeemik snarled, hefting a crude spear.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Clouds leaned against the cave wall, attempting a posture of casual charm. He let the silence hang for a
            moment, his clear blue eyes, which reflected the dim light like oasis water, locking onto the goblin's beady
            black ones.</p>

        <p>"You," Clouds rumbled, his voice dropping to a low, earnest purr. He fixed his gaze on Yeemik, his clear blue
            eyes wide and intense, reflecting the dim light like pools of water.</p>

        <p>I choked on my water and I stared, my pen hovering over my notes. I looked at Clouds's player, who was
            beaming with pride."I need you to make a Persuasion check for that."</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Persuasion Check: 19"
        </blockquote>

        <p>Yeemik blinked. He looked from the small, flirting cat barbarian to the other goblins, then back. A slow,
            nasty grin spread across his face. He puffed out his chest slightly and turned back to Clouds.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Maybe you and me, we can do business. You kill Klarg, the big bugbear boss, and I give you your dwarf
            friends back. Understand?"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "I understand that you have lovely eyes. Shiny. Like seaglass. For a goblin." Clouds flashed a smile, his
            seaglass bangles catching the light.
        </blockquote>

        <p>I was on the verge of tears from trying not to laugh. "Roll another one. With advantage because why not."</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Persuasion Check with Advantage: 19"
        </blockquote>

        <p>Yeemik scratched his chin, a faint blush against his green skin.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You you think so? Is true. Klarg never appreciates my attractables. He is all 'smash, crush.' No subtlety."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            "A brute. You, however you have vision. We can help each other." Cloud held a hand to his chest, faked
            surprise.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Nomu and Fluffy watched from the bushes, utterly dumbfounded as their barbarian successfully flirted with a
            goblin lieutenant. After a tense negotiation, Yeemik agreed to let them pass to deal with Klarg. They
            slipped into the dark, damp cave, the agreement hanging in the air as precariously as a dagger on a ledge.
            The stream gurgled, and from deeper in, they could hear the deep, rumbling snarl of a wolf and the crude
            laughter of a bugbear.</p>

        <p>I looked at my notes, then back at the players. "Okay, I cannot believe that worked, but you are in the cave.
            The main chamber is just ahead. You can see Klarg, a large bugbear, patting his wolf, Ripper. Two other
            goblins are with him."</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Let us ambush them," Nomu's player whispered.
        </blockquote>

        <p>I called for Stealth checks.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Stealth Checks: 3, 1, and 8. Failures, all of you. Nomu, your armor clanks. Fluffy, you step on a loose
            stone. Clouds, your seaglass bracelets choose this moment to chime like a bell. Klarg's head snaps up. His
            eyes narrow."
        </blockquote>

        <p>I looked at each of my players in turn, a grim smile on my face.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Everyone, roll for initiative."
        </blockquote>
