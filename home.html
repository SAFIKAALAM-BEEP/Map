        <h1>Home</h1>

        <p>The heavy wooden door slammed shut, a definitive sound that seals me off from the world. Here, in the empire
            of my room, I am the sole sovereign, the only law was my own.</p>

        <p>My body fell backward, and the mattress accepted my weight with a soft, sighing groan. My legs, freed from
            the tyranny of standing straight, folded upward, my socked feet pressing flat against the cool, smooth cloth
            of my headboard. My spine curved, a human bridge between the sheets and the bed frame. I was a fluid
            pretzel, a creature of impossible angles. I wonder if I'd taste good.</p>

        <p>I have a weird friend who tells me he'll eat my leg whenever I'm upset. It's a strange way to comfort people.
            My liver would be more tender. More nutritional. (He's probably not secretly a cannibal?)</p>

        <p>Restless, I untwisted and slid into my desk chair, curling my legs beneath me until they vanished into a
            crisscrossed knot. A pins-and-needles tingling soon bloomed in my feet, a protest from my compressed
            nerves.The stillness was a cage. Pushing back from the desk, I planted my hands on the rug, kicked my legs
            up against the wall, and for one glorious, blood-rushing second, the world inverted. The ceiling was the
            floor, my hair brushed the fibers of the carpet, and then with a waver, a wobble, I collapsed into a heap of
            helpless laughter on the floor. My body was not amused.</p>

        <p>The freedom of my asylum was not without its hazards. A careless step toward the desk ended in a sharp,
            blinding crack of my little toe against the table leg. I hobble, clutching my foot, a silent curse on my
            lips. The same table's corner, a jagged laminate tooth, lay in ambush for my hip, a meeting that left a
            familiar throbbing ache.</p>

        <p>I make it back to my seat, one leg swinging a frantic, restless pendulum swing beneath the table, while the
            other remained trapped, numb and heavy, beneath my own weight.</p>

        <p>Then, the crown descended. The headphones settled over my ears, and my private universes invaded my skull.
            The frantic, screaming guitar of a rock anthem was a lightning strike, charging the air. My body became the
            instrument; I was the lead singer, slamming an power chord on an invisible guitar for a roaring stadium of
            empty air. The beat shifted, morphing into the complex, staccato poetry of rap. My feet found a rhythm on
            the floorboards. Then, a shift: a lone acoustic guitar, a voice full of aching vulnerability of love. My
            arms lifted, one hand on the small of their back, the other clasped in mine. We swept into a dramatic tango,
            weaving through the clutter of discarded clothes and books, a perfect, silent dance for two.</p>

        <p>My lips remained sealed in public, but here, in absolute solitude, my voice was set free. It was unpolished,
            sometimes cracking, but it was fearless, serenading the walls.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I ache for the touch of your lips, dear<br>
            But much more for the touch of your whips, dear<br>
            You can raise welts<br>
            Like nobody else<br>
            As we dance to the Masochism Tango"<br>
            (Tom Lehrer - Masochism Tango)
        </blockquote>

        <p>When the music became a battle hymn, my hand closed around the hilt of the plastic play sword from the dollar
            store. In my grip, it became Excalibur, its blade catching the light. A monster of shadow and closet-door
            creaks loomed. I parried a blow from the curtain, thrust my blade toward the dresser, and ducked behind the
            chair, my heart hammering a war drum in my chest. I charged, leaping from the bed-fortress, my feet skidding
            on the wooden floor, a near-catastrophe averted by a wild, grasping hand on the doorframe. I was a hero, a
            warrior, a savior, breathless and triumphant. I was a creature of pure, undirected motion.</p>

        <p>Then, in a single, sorrowful note. The scene shifted. I was a siren, my voice a weapon of devastating beauty.
            I looked into the eyes of my imaginary lover, my prey, my heart breaking. The betrayal was inevitable.
            Unable to devour him, refusing to let any other claim him, I led him to the precipice of my bed. With a
            heart-wrenching cry that tore from my throat, I pushed him into the abyss, his silent fall accompanied by
            the dying notes of the chorus.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "And here it is, our final night alive<br>
            And as the earth runs to the ground<br>
            Oh girl it's you that I lie with<br>
            As the atom bomb locks in"<br>
            (Matt Maltese - As The World Caves In)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Spent, I fell backward into the soft fortress of my comforter. But the chaos merely transformed. I wrestled
            the blanket, twisting it around me until I was a tight, fabric-swaddled burrito, my arms pinned uselessly to
            my sides. "Never! I will never tell you my secrets!" I gasped, writhing against my bonds, a captured spy
            defying invisible torturers. The blanket became a serpent's skin, and I shed my human form, slithering,
            legless, across the rug. Or I simply gave in to the momentum, rolling over and over, from the bed to the
            floor and back again, a dizzy, giggling heap, for no reason at all.</p>

            "Round and round, the dancing laundry<br>
            Let's lose our minds, forget the time<br>
            And everything will be just fine"<br>
            (Carole & Tuesday - Round & Laundry)
        </blockquote>

        <p>There are calmer forms of madness. When my arms lay heavy on the desk, my gaze locked on the glowing screen
            of my laptop, my fingers navigating pixelated worlds. Or when my hands move in a frantic, steady scratch, my
            pen conjures other worlds in the pages of my journal. Sometimes, there'll be a heavy book in my hands and
            I'd read for hours until the words bleed into my dreams. Other times, a catchy, six-syllable phrase looped
            in my mind, and my body responded with a silent, worm-like wiggle in the chair, a seizure to a private
            rhythm. Sometimes, I do nothing at all. I just stare out the window, watching the clouds pass by, their
            slow, grayscale drift a silent movie.</p>

            Here among these vibrant lights<br>
            Pure delights surround us as we sail<br>
            Signed, yours truly, the whale"<br>

        <p>My room is full of mirrors.</p>

        <p>The one across from my bed is the largest, the grand overseer. Its ornate gold and silver frame captures the
            entire chaotic theater of my room: the rumpled comforter, the shelves crammed with books, figures, and
            stuffed animals, the posters, and the discarded clothes piled on the dresser. A tall, white-framed one
            stands guard beside the closet, a sentinel of style. Opposite my desk hangs a simple black rectangle,
            reflecting a world of organized chaos: messy stacks of papers and books, the glowing laptop, and a
            perpetually cluttered keyboard.</p>

        <p>They say a person surrounded by their own reflection is a narcissist. They might picture me as a storybook
            queen, whispering vainly into her magic looking glass. But if I were to stand in the center of the room and
            ask, "Mirror, mirror on my walls, who is the fairest, the most brilliant, the most insane of them all?" the
            answering silence would not be one of flattery.</p>

        <p>The black mirror above my desk would be the first to break the quiet, its voice like the dry rustle of
            textbook pages. It would watch me not with admiration, but with academic disappointment. "Brilliant?" it
            would scoff, its tone flat. "Your understanding of Fourier analysis is, at best, superficial. Ask me again
            when you've solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem. And for heaven's sake, eat a sandwich
            before you attempt it. Your cognitive function is declining in direct correlation with your blood sugar."
        </p>

        <p>From the white-framed mirror by the closet, a voice like chilled champagne and shattered crystal would ring
            out. "Fairest? In *that*?" it would draw a haughty, nonexistent breath. "That sartorial catastrophe you've
            assembled is an insult to the very concept of vision. Those pants clash with that jacket with a violence
            that offends my very frame. I would sooner reflect a brick wall. The white top. Now. This is not a request."
        </p>

        <p>But the mirror across from my bed… its silence is different. It is a deep, observing well. In the deep quiet
            of a late night, when the only light is the moon's glow from the window, my reflection in it seems less
            solid, more like a suggestion. This grand mirror holds a different kind of counsel, speaking in a voice both
            chilling and intimate, a whisper from the shadows.</p>

        <p>"Oh, darling," it would murmur, its tone almost affectionate. "The hurricane has visited your hair again, I
            see. The world is not ready for this masterpiece of disarray. Perhaps you should stay here with me." Its
            gaze would drift. "These bangles on your wrist… they look like beautiful restraints. As if they belong
            there. Perhaps you should make their placement more… permanent. Remove them, with the bone still inside, and
            display them on our shelves. I'll reflect their beauty for an eternity." A chilling smile would seem to form
            in the glass, a stark contrast to my own raw emotion. "And your face, streaked with tears… how pretty. They
            make patterns like fractured stars. I could keep that image forever, frozen in my glass. Consider my offer,
            and I will personally attend to whatever caused such a beautiful sorrow."</p>

        <p>I have a favorite mirror, but that is my secret. And honestly, I think my mirrors are far more in love with
            themselves than I could ever be.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Your eyes are like the boldest of obsidian<br>
            …like the glass from a volcano<br>
            That could blow you to oblivion<br>
            … Your eyes are pools of ink<br>
            That could tell like a thousand stories<br>
            … The night is in your eyes<br>
            The universe is part of you"<br>
            (The Eye Color Ballad - Nathan Apollo)
        </blockquote>

        <p>In these moments, I am alone, yet profoundly accompanied by the universes inside my head. I am every hero,
            every villain, every lover, every star, and every lost soul.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Pressure wouldn't squash me and fire couldn't burn…<br>
            I can live life in vacuums for years with no drink<br>
            And put up with hardships more than you can think<br>
            If I shed all my liquid and let myself dry out<br>
            I'll shrivel and sleep for some 15-odd years<br>
            I'd wake up, come water, and get on with living<br>
            For I am a tardigrade<br>
            And I'll stay at home<br>
            I'd not trade it for anything<br>
            Not a knife, a cup or a throne"<br>
            (The Tardigrade - Cosmo Sheldrake)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The pressures of the outside world cannot squash me here. The fire of expectations cannot burn me. This is
            mine.</p>

        <p>Finally, the last of the energy crackled out of me. My limbs grew heavy, my breathing deepened. I sank into
            the mattress, the soft cotton of the sheets cool against my sweaty skin. The universe of my room hums its
            quiet, perfect, and gloriously insane tune, a sanctuary where the warrior, the dancer, and the king who
            rules this small, chaotic, and perfect domain can truly, madly, be.</p>
