        <h1>Library</h1>

        <p>The feel of pages, a dry whisper against my fingers. The sound of them turning, a soft percussion against the
            distant, rhythmic clicking of pens and keyboards. My body is melted into a red beanbag in the children's
            corner, a deflated, kidney shaped throne. Why did the kids get the amorphous chairs? The geometry of
            adulthood was all harsh right angles and unyielding wood. I am not supposed to be here, but no smaller
            gremlin would dare reclaim it. I was a mountain in their valley. This space is mine by a silent, unspoken
            treaty.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I'm a very ordinary human being; I just happen to like reading books." (Haruki Murakami, 1Q84)
        </blockquote>

        <p>A huge circular balcony cuts into the middle of the room, its railing a cold ribbon of steel and glass. From
            this perch, I look down upon the main floor, a grid of tables, each with its lone figure bent over a screen
            or a book. I see the crowns of their heads, the balding spots and careful partings, as they type and frown
            over their serious, adult work. The role reversal is a quiet, private joke. They are the specimens in a
            tank, busy and unaware of the observer above.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Why is it that adults are always telling kids to go watch television as though we have nothing better to
            do?" (Ingrid Law, Savvy)
        </blockquote>

        <p>But on this floor, my floor, the view is different. I watch the cars slide past the vast windows, silent
            through the glass, like fish in another, larger tank. There are tables of every shape: hexagons, squares,
            circles, where other kids are piecing together posters for school, a landscape of scattered markers and
            concentrated silence. The space is surprisingly quiet.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "He looked at me screaming and plugging my ears and at the tears dripping like the kitchen tap down my
            cheeks; my words finally hit him, and he listened. Fish twisted sharply from me to Will Junior as though
            suddenly adding two and two and getting twenty-seven, even though most people could only ever get four."
            (Ingrid Law, Savvy)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I move through the canyons of bookcases. The space is a narrow, vertical slit, and I fill it, a key in a
            lock. No one can find me here. No one is watching. No one is judging.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You can keep as quiet as you like, but one of these days somebody is going to find you." (Haruki Murakami,
            1Q84)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I gather books like a kleptomaniac, drawn to an interesting cover or a compelling blurb, until the stack is a
            tower, a leaning ziggurat of universes that strains the very muscles in my arms.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Everyone says that he fell because he flew too close to the sun," his father said, "but he flew, do you see
            what I mean, Son? He was able to fly. It doesn't matter if you fall, if you were a bird for even just a few
            seconds." (Agustina Bazterrica, Tender is the Flesh)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sometimes, I simply sit between the books, my body collapsing into the narrow aisle, creating a human shaped
            interruption in the orderly lines of the library. My back presses against one shelf, my legs splayed out, my
            feet nudging the opposite shelf. The space was not made for this, and I contort, my spine a question mark
            against the book wall.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "A poem-shaped space, I thought. A poem-shaped space. I tried to hold a poem-shaped space in my mind.
            Sometimes the work of life is like preparing a bedroom for a guest: sweeping the floor, emptying the
            ash-tray, watering the sloping aloe plant. Opening the window wide to let new air in. I did all this inside
            my head, behind my eyes, while my fingers made words appear and waited for that guest to arrive." (Sean
            Michaels, Do You Remember Being Born?)
        </blockquote>

        <p>At a table, my arms form a circle, my head resting in the crook of my left arm, my right a crane holding a
            book aloft. It is a temporary equilibrium, a perfect, comfortable geometry that lasts only until the next
            page needs turning, forcing a total reconfiguration of my limbs. I am tired today, but today I am reading.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "I'm here to heal you. If you want sympathy, go to the nursery." (Erin Hunter, Warrior Cats: Dark River)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I am a kidnapper of worlds. I kidnap the books after scanning them properly through the self-scan checkout.
            Beep… beep… beep… beep.... When I take them home, to the subway, or to a coffee shop, it is another puzzle.
            How to fit the varying, rectangular shapes into my bag? How to balance the weight? It is a prelude, a
            movement of my thoughts as the fictional worlds prepare to invade my personal spaces.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Well, being blind feels normal to me." (Erin Hunter, Warrior Cats: Dark River)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Finding the most optimal position to read is an endless quest. I know lying on my stomach is a sin against
            posture, but surely a few hours will not hurt. Besides, when my shoulders inevitably betray me in ten
            minutes, I will be forced to change position again.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there." (Albert Camus, The Stranger)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I lie on my back, a starfish on my bed, and prop the book on my chest, a weight on my ribcage.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I don't get why a person's smile is considered attractive. When someone smiles, they're showing their
            skeleton." (Agustina Bazterrica, Tender is the Flesh)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sometimes I curl on my side, a comma, my left hand propping up my head, my right holding the book open.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "What does it mean that you are there and we are here? Is there meaning or is it random chance?" (Adrian
            Tchaikovsky, Children of Time)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sometimes I stay up late and build a fortress of blankets, a cocoon against the sleeping world, and curl up
            inside it with a book light.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Why does the night have to be so beautiful? As I walk through the night, I remember what Mitsutsuka said to
            me. 'Because at night, only half the world remains.'" (Mieko Kawakami, All the Lovers in the Night)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I once read for seventy two hours straight. Time lost its shape. My vision blurred, the words swimming on the
            page. My limbs became heavy, foreign objects. The line between my body and the room, between my mind and the
            story, dissolved completely.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Two years passed. It was not a time that felt particularly slow or particularly fast. It was, however, the
            time in your life when you most vividly experienced life's elapsing. The sense that your life was wearing
            through. Not that death was coming nearer but that the progress of your life would continue at a speed and
            with a permanence you were not prepared for." (Sean Michaels, Do You Remember Being Born?)
        </blockquote>

        <p>In the silence of the library, surrounded by the ghosts of a thousand stories, the space itself is alive. The
            cylindrical pillars become my backrests. The shelves are not just wood and laminate, they are the ribs of a
            great, slumbering beast. The high, colorful ceiling is an otherworldly sky, and the balcony a cliff face
            from which to observe the tiny, busy lives below.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Humans have a difficult time with 'natural.' We are better at 'interesting' or 'beautiful' or 'forceful'
            than we are at 'natural.' Everything is an exertion, everything is performance." (Sean Michaels, Do You
            Remember Being Born?)
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is my performance. The library is my stage. I am a liquid taking the shape of its vessel. I am a giant
            compressed between shelves, a dwarf in the open square of the atrium, a contortionist in the aisles.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I saw how you were just yourself, without needing anyone to define you or be around you. I wanted to be
            like that, too." (Yoru Sumino, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I am writing myself into the narrative of this place, a story told not in words, but in the shapes my body
            makes in this space.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "My present self is formed almost completely of the people around me... Infecting each other like this is
            how we maintain ourselves as human is what I think." (Sayaka Murata, Convenience Store Woman)
        </blockquote>

        <p>And the books are my co-conspirators. They are not just stories. They are physical objects with weight and
            texture. Their smell of paper and glue is the library's scent. They are my colleagues, my friends, my
            infection. My speech patterns might be borrowed from the living, but my thoughts, my inner voice, is a
            chorus of the authors on these shelves.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Books,' I say sleepily. 'They don't change either. If you read a book and look at it again later on, it's
            still the same thing. But it's exciting all over again." (Truus Matti, Departure Time)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I read. I shift. I exist in this story-shaped space, waiting for the next guest to arrive, for the next world
            to open. The goal is not just to finish the book, but to find that perfect, fleeting harmony: the precise
            curve of the spine, the ideal distribution of weight, the exact angle of light, where the body, the book,
            and the space become one single, seamless entity.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "We get born, and sometime later we die. And in between, we're happy and sad, we feel love and we feel fear,
            we eat and we sleep and we hurt like everyone else." (Ingrid Law, Savvy)
        </blockquote>

        <p>And then, the need to shift, to turn the page, to breathe, breaks the spell. The geometry fails, and the
            search begins again.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "When will we be able to live rather than just focusing on surviving?" (Sayaka Murata, Earthlings)
        </blockquote>

        <p>In these moments, between one position and the next, I am not just surviving. I am, completely and utterly,
            living.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Alpash moved to go, and for a moment Holsten was going to stop him, to ask that impossible question that
            historians can never ask, regarding the things they study: What is it like to be you? A question nobody can
            step far enough out of their own frame of reference to answer." (Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The other explorers are islands. The woman in the rectangular study carrel, a perfect cube of concentration.
            The student sprawled in a semi circle on the floor, his notes a chaotic constellation around him. We are but
            temporary statues in this fluid museum.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "If there had been some tiny bead present in the brain of all humans, that had told each other, They are
            like you; that had drawn some thin silk thread of empathy, person to person, in a planet-wide net – what
            might then have happened? Would there have been the same wars, massacres, persecutions and crusades?"
            (Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time)
        </blockquote>

        <p>I look at them, these strangers, each in their own shaped space, each holding their own world in their hands.
            The thin silk threads here are the sentences, connecting me to the minds on the page, to the other silent
            readers. Bridges between the islands. For a few hours, we are a net, a quiet, peaceful world. A shared,
            unspoken understanding of the need for this place, for the quiet. We are alone, but together.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "This will be the first of a thousand worlds that we will give life to. For we are gods, and we are lonely,
            so we shall create." (Adrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time)
        </blockquote>

        <p>My mind gives life to the worlds in the word, and the library creates the space for it to breathe. I am both
            god and worshipper in this quiet, paper temple.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Find me now. Before someone else does." (Haruki Murakami, 1Q84)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The story always finds me. I am just here, making a space for it, a shape for it to land. I slide a book from
            the shelf. The cover is cool and smooth. I find a new space, a trapezoidal slice of floor between a pillar
            and a shelf. I fold myself into it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as
            well have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done
            another. And so?" (Albert Camus, The Stranger)
        </blockquote>

        <p>And so I turn the page.</p>
