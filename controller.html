        <h1 class="paper-title">Am I in Love With You?</h1>

        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Love is a quantifiable condition, observable through a series of behavioral
            trials and emotional metrics.</p>

        <h2 class="trial-heading">Trial 1</h2>

        <p>The first betrayal was a small, folded square of paper slipped across the aisle during a math exam. I, the
            teacher's pet, a staunch opponent of academic dishonesty, did not hesitate. Our separate desks were no
            obstacle. When our answers matched, it was a silent, reassuring victory. When they differed, it was a
            frantic, whispered discourse. I remember studying your handwriting on the swapped papers, the way you dotted
            your 'i's with perfect, curved circles. I decided you had the second-best handwriting of all the boys. The
            best was your friend's, whose script was more elegant than any girl's.</p>

        <p>But it wasn't because of your handwriting.</p>

        <p>It might seem shallow, and honestly, it was. I started playing your favorite game, even though I'd never
            really held a controller before in my life. I studied its rules and maps like they were chapters in a
            textbook. To be completely honest, the monsters terrified me and the sudden, crashing sounds made me jump. I
            preferred the quiet parts, exploring the empty buildings and forgotten cities.</p>

        <p>But sometimes, I had to wonder: did I actually enjoy the game, or did I just enjoy the sound of your
            excitement? Your laughter was a better reward than any in-game treasure. It gave me something to talk to you
            about, a bridge to you, built on pixelated foundations. A bridge I always meant to cross, but never did.</p>

        <p>The moment you turned to me, the moment I had the chance to speak, I'd freeze. My words would vanish. It
            wasn't a lack of interest. It was the opposite. Your voice was a magnet that scrambled my thoughts into
            static. I swear, just five seconds before, I had a whole sentence perfectly formed in my head.</p>

        <p>But it wasn't because of your voice.</p>

        <p>I remember curling on the carpet, inching closer to you under the pretense of reading my own book. You were
            reading too, and I latched onto that. Reading. I liked reading. I could talk about that.</p>

        <p>I asked what you were reading. I don't remember the title, but I remember the conversation tilting, turning
            academic. Your reading level was just below mine, and in a flash of stupid, unthinking competitiveness, I
            made fun of it. That wasn't what I meant at all. It's like your presence short-circuited the part of my
            brain responsible for diplomacy. You fell silent, clearly annoyed, and a knot of panic tightened in my
            stomach. I didn't know how to fix it.</p>

        <p>But thenâ€¦ you smiled. A challenge. "I'll catch up soon," you said, "and then I'll beat you."</p>

        <p>I had no reply. My words had abandoned me completely. "I'm busy," I mumbled, and buried my burning face back
            in the book I was definitely no longer reading. The words on the page swam into a meaningless gray blur,
            every one of them replaced by the memory of your smile.</p>

        <p>But it wasn't because of your smile.</p>

        <p>For the first time, a teacher yelled at me. I was always a good student, so the words: "You embarrassed me in
            front of the whole class! How haven't you memorized your speech yet? Even your partner had his memorized!"
            felt like a physical blow. Then she left, and the dark, empty classroom seemed to swallow me. You were my
            partner, so you saw it all. My mind scrambled for an explanation: I've never talked in front of so many
            people. I just blanked. I couldn't even remember the first word. But the explanation wouldn't come out.
            Instead, all I could choke out was, "I'm sorry."</p>

        <p>You didn't get up and leave. You just watched me cry. I had never cried in front of anyone before, and I was
            trying so hard to choke the sobs back. "It wasn't your fault!" you said, your voice tight with an anger that
            was for my sake. "She was so mean!" Then you walked over and asked for my speech. I handed you the crumpled
            paper, now spotted with tears. You smoothed it out, read it, and then you smiled. "This is so cool," you
            said. "I'll help you memorize it."</p>

        <p>And you did. You helped me memorize my speech, secretly, during every lunch period. We'd get permission, and
            it would be just the two of us in that classroom every day, our voices echoing as we practiced.</p>

        <p>Did you know I actually have a pretty good memory? I remember you really liked robots and wanted to build
            them on other planets. I remember the sound your sneakers made squeaking against the gym floor when you
            tried to do your impression of a Mars rover. I hope your dream comes true.</p>

        <p>I remember your mom is a doctor. I pretended to be disgusted by that graphic story you told me about her
            pulling a long, parasitic worm from a patient, but the truth is, I found it fascinating. I copied the
            grossed-out reactions of our classmates because I was afraid of seeming weird, of being different from
            everyone else.</p>

        <p>I remember when you were frustrated about an argument with your friend. I was so stubbornly on your side that
            you actually started defending him, and then you realized how silly the whole fight was, and we both started
            laughing.</p>

        <p>And I'm sorry, but I remember lying to you. I had my speech memorized by the second day. I only pretended to
            forget a line, to fumble a word, to question an inflection, just so we could keep meeting.</p>

        <p>I liked hearing your speech, too. It was cool. It was great, and I got to hear you repeat it every day. I
            just didn't know how to say that back then.</p>

        <p>It was because of your warmth. Your voice, which could make my thoughts scramble. Your smile that made the
            words on a page blur. Your laughter, your handwriting, our arguments, your competitiveness, your
            "horrifying" stories. You being the first person to ever see me cry.</p>

        <p>And my lies.</p>

        <p>The day we got our middle school acceptance letters was a formality. I opened the letter, saw the name of a
            school I'd never heard you mention, and shrugged. "Oh. I guess this is it," I said, the words were like
            simple facts. That's just how it is.</p>

        <p>But your face did something I didn't expect. It fell. The easy confidence you always carried tightened into
            confusion. "There must have been a mistake," you said, your voice low. "You didn't select the same school as
            me? Can't you change it?"</p>

        <p>The question was so earnest it felt like a physical push. My own logic, my simple acceptance, suddenly felt
            cold and stupid. A defensive, flippant thing leaped from my mouth before I could cage it. "No. Why would I?"
        </p>

        <p>It was the wrong answer. I knew it the moment it left my stupid, stupid mouth. You had no response for that.
            Your gaze dropped, and you offered a small: "Oh... Good luck."</p>

        <p>"...You too."</p>

        <p>On the last day, after the graduation speeches, everyone was swapping numbers, making promises to their
            friends that we all knew were too big to keep. I wanted to ask for yours, but I didn't know how to bridge
            the gap. We were islands, each surrounded by our own separate seas of people.</p>

        <p>And then our eyes met across the crowd.</p>

        <p>You didn't call my name. I didn't call yours. The wide, easy smile you'd been giving everyone else faded into
            something hesitant, almost neutral, as you looked at me. It lasted only a second before it softened into a
            small, private smile, accompanied by a slow wave and a single, silent thumbs-up.</p>

        <p>I smiled back and returned the gesture.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until years later, replaying that moment in my head, that I finally figured out what I had been
            feeling. I'm a lot denser than I look when it comes to things like that.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Observations:</h3>
        <ul class="observation-list">
            <li>Documented Fixation: Subject authored numerous unsent communications detailing P.O.I.'s intelligence,
                "weird kindness," and compulsive competitiveness. Frequent praise of his "compassion," a term directly
                correlated with the incident in the dark classroom.</li>
            <li>Parasomatic Markings: Observed repeated, furtive sketching of cardiac symbols in notebook margins,
                followed immediately by aggressive erasure leading to substrate degradation. A clear approach-avoidance
                pattern.</li>
            <li>Schedule Disruption: Subject forgot to complete two homework assignmentsâ€”a significant deviation from a
                previously flawless record. Noted preoccupation superseded academic imperatives.</li>
            <li>Affective Lability: Subject's emotional state was highly variable. Documented instances of inappropriate
                smiling while recalling P.O.I.'s humor, followed by acute anxiety over perceived social missteps, and
                punctuated by frequent, unprompted sighing.</li>
            <li>Post-Separation Adjustment: Subject's cognitive functions and daily routines returned to established
                baseline following the graduation event and termination of regular contact.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="results">
            <strong>Results:</strong> Data suggests a proto-romantic attachment. The subject's emotional intelligence
            was insufficient for proper classification at the time of trial. Case closed.
        </div>

        <h2 class="trial-heading">Trial 2</h2>

        <p>In middle school, I was still a dedicated student, so it was a shock to hear my friends start dating. School
            was not the place to focus on anything but studying! My reaction was always, "Well, that's great, congrats,
            but we have a science exam next period. Did you study the main types of rocks? They're igneous, sedimentary
            and metamorphic..."</p>

        <p>It wasn't that I hated 'love' or anything. I'd been introduced to the wonderful world of romance novels and
            absorbed every word, and had started secretly writing fan fiction about fictional characters. These were
            worlds I kept entirely to myself until one day in 7th grade.</p>

        <p>I was sitting next to this girl who usually sat a seat away from me in all our classes. We were always
            arranged by our last names, separated by this annoying guy in the middle. We ended up sitting next to each
            other during lunch at one point. It was maybe out of boredom, or maybe I just wanted someone to have a peek
            into my world. I wasn't lonely, per se, but I wanted someone to justâ€¦see me as more than just a walking
            textbook, forever glaring at the whiteboard like it had personally offended me.</p>

        <p>I was so narcissistic. Despite reading books that were literally made by other people, I had this thought
            that I was the only one with these entire worlds in my head. So I asked her. "Do you imagine worlds in your
            head too?"</p>

        <p>To my surprise, she said yes.</p>

        <p>I was entranced. I wanted to know everything about her worlds. There was a magic academy with the coolest
            magic system, a combination of elements from other stories. It was awesome. Andâ€¦ There was a cute love
            story, too. I felt my defenses slipping, and I let her into one of my worlds, one of my fanfictions. A
            sci-fi world in the future with controlled interdimensional travel, where dragons from other worlds would
            bond with my characters as they fought a war against an enemy faction trying to invade their home.</p>

        <p>I had inserted a character from another story that I really liked. He had this fierce sense of justice, and
            losing his family young made him want to grow up too fast. I wanted him to suffer less, to have a happy
            ending. It was a stupid solution: I created a love interest for him. Someone who understood his pain but
            could help him recover from his obsession with saving others over dealing with his own. Someone to make him
            feel like a kid again.</p>

        <p>Friends to lovers was a trope I had an unhealthy obsession with at the time.</p>

        <p>She praised my worlds, even weaving in threads of inspiration from her own. We would talk about it every
            lunch period, our heads bent close together in hushed whispers, a secret society of two built on the frantic
            exchange of folded papers. I started growing more protective of her, a fierce, sudden instinct. The annoying
            guy who always sat between us became the bane of my existence. He was always trying to copy her homework!
            And like the hypocritical goody-two-shoes I was, I'd swoop in and force him to do his own work. She was just
            too nice, too willing to help. Clearly, she needed a barrier against nuisances. And that's what I decided to
            become.</p>

        <p>I became her barrier. I started talking more in class, loudly discussing the shows and books I liked,
            creating a distraction to shield our little world from intruders. I didn't realize it at the time, but in
            building this wall to protect her, I was accidentally letting more pieces of the real me slip out for
            everyone to see.</p>

        <p>I was genuinely excited to go to school because it meant I could see her every day. We joined the same club
            activities, we traded our favorite books, and we spent hours drawing the landscapes of our imagined worlds.
            We had so much in common. It was just so much fun, you know? To finally talk about the things you love with
            someone who justâ€¦ gets it.</p>

        <p>The day the high school acceptance letters came was the day the map of my future was redrawn, and my heart
            sank when I saw our paths diverging. I was devastated. She had worked so hard for her school, and she was so
            proud. I was proud of her, too, of course I was. But beneath the pride was a cold, sharp fear I didn't
            understand.</p>

        <p>This time, I couldn't just accept it with a shrug. I didn't understand why it felt so different, so wrong. My
            body seemed to understand before my brain did. I started finding reasons to be near her, my feet carrying me
            on a new, longer route home just so I could walk with her, clinging to those extra twenty minutes like a
            lifeline.</p>

        <p>And then there was the jealousy. A sharp, ugly feeling I'd never met before. She had other friends, friends
            who seemed to know a version of her I didn't, friends who lived closer and would see her every day. I felt
            like just another pebble in her stream, and I was terrified the current would finally pull me away and she
            wouldn't even notice I was gone.</p>

        <p>But then she said it. Two words that hit me like a train and anchored me to the riverbed all at once: "best
            friend."</p>

        <p>I don't know why, but those two words fixed something broken in me. They reassured me in a way nothing else
            could. And Iâ€¦ I loved them. I used them everywhere, like a little kid who'd just learned a magical
            incantation. Hehe. My best friend.</p>

        <p>We kept in contact through high school, getting into all sorts of fun shenanigans over texts and calls, and
            we still talk to this day. She is my anchor. She is the best friend without whom this map of my life would
            have led to a much quieter, more closed-off person. I wouldn't have learned to share my worlds without her
            first teaching me how.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Observations:</h3>
        <ul class="observation-list">
            <li>Intellectual & Creative Merging: Subject's private world-building activities shifted from a solitary to
                a collaborative pursuit, with the P.O.I. acting as a co-creator and primary audience. Subject exhibited
                high investment in developing shared narrative universes.</li>
            <li>Protective Ritualization: Subject self-appointed as a "barrier" against perceived social nuisances,
                demonstrating high territoriality and a proprietary sense of guardianship over the P.O.I.'s time and
                attention.</li>
            <li>Resource Reallocation: Subject deliberately altered their daily transit route, sacrificing significant
                personal time to maximize proximity, indicating a high prioritization of the bond.</li>
            <li>Novel Emotional Data: The emergence of jealousy was recorded. A new, volatile variable suggesting a
                perceived threat to the relationship's exclusivity.</li>
            <li>Stabilizing Input: The lexical signifier "best friend" functioned as a powerful cognitive anchor,
                immediately resolving anxiety and codifying the relationship's permanence, as evidenced by the subject's
                repetitive and affirmative use of the term.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="results">
            <strong>Results:</strong> Data indicates a deep, creative, and intensely devoted platonic attachment. The
            subject's self-reported identity and social development are directly correlated with the formation of this
            bond. The relationship served as a primary catalyst for the subject's increased social openness and
            emotional expression. Classification: Platonic Soulmate. The bond is foundational to the subject's social
            development and creative identity. No intervention required.

            re-evaluated. It is a fictional narrative, drafted by the subject as a hypothetical contingency for
            "rescuing" the P.O.I. from a variety of exaggerated, non-specific social scenarios. The tone is melodramatic
            and aligns with the subject's established pattern of expressing care through grandiose, fictionalized
            narratives. It does not constitute a literal threat, merely a peculiar and somewhat concerning manifestation
            of their protective devotion.

        <div class="critical-alert">
            [This trial should have been rejected. Who approved this? It's a clear violation of the Belmont principles:
            respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Why? Because the subject was also the lead researcher, and
            the experiment was designed to fail.]
        </div>

        <p>This was less a feeling and more a sentence. Every action was wrapped in a sweet, giddy happiness the moment
            you texted, all tangled up with the icky, gut-churning certainty that you weren't mine. It was a secret I
            couldn't tell anyone, an eldritch monster with a tentacle around my throat, because I couldn't even
            comprehend it myself. It was beyond my mortal understanding. I was silenced.</p>

        <p>I dropped everything for you. I felt a physical, weird pain whenever you were upset. I knew immediately when
            you were upset. You only stay up late when you're spiraling. You know you completely wrecked my sleep
            schedule, right? I would spend entire nights composing speeches to comfort you, crafting each sentence so it
            wouldn't sound like a hollow platitude. You put my literary analysis and vocabulary to the test more than
            any English exam. You were the only subject worth losing sleep over, though I resented every minute of it.
            I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>I adored you with a ferocity that scared me. It was a secret guardianship that spun dark, intricate fantasies
            of capturing every person who ever hurt you and sealing them away in the prison of my reflection, their
            malice dismembered and displayed for my eyes only, a permanent warning to keep your world safe. My
            admiration was so complete it became a form of worship: you were everything I aspired to be. The idea of
            tarnishing that perfection was alien to me. All I truly wanted, with a desperate, quiet ache, was to know
            what it felt like to be in your arms.</p>

        <p>Just kidding. I don't care about you. Not even a little. You're nothing to me, and I'm going to cut you out
            of my life with a smile on my face.</p>

        <p>I lied.</p>

        <p>You are a poison. An addiction. My synapses fire for you in a futile loop, my dopamine circuits craving a
            reward that never arrives, and my prefrontal cortex has gone completely offline. You shuffled my emotions
            and logic into a deck of useless cards. I've become so detached from my own mind that I've lost feeling in
            my body. I failed you. I gave you terrible advice, not because I wanted to, but because I couldn't string
            two logical thoughts together when I was talking to you. I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>What a hypocrite I am. I'm the one who tells my friends to be logical, to guard their hearts, all while I
            would have rewritten my own DNA for a chance to be someone you'd love. When did I become this person? When
            did my own worth become so negotiable?</p>

        <p>You weren't even my type. You were static, background noise in the grand broadcast of my life a year ago.
            Now, I struggle to even recall the specific geometry of your face, only the seismic effect of your presence.
            So when did this switch flip? When did you become the main event?</p>

        <p>Is this what they call love? They make it sound like a sudden, beautiful collision. But this feels like a
            chronic illness. It hurts. This can't be right.</p>

        <p>Every time you dismissed yourself, every time you mentioned some other girl, a silent scream would build in
            my throat: Don't you see what I see? You are fascinating. You are worthwhile. Stop it. Be logical. You are
            wanted. You are needed. You are liked, right here, by me, so please just stop.</p>

        <p>Then there were the nights we'd talk for hours, and you'd just vanish. You fell asleep, but in that silence,
            I'd feel a visceral, aching absence, as if you'd shipped out to war and left me on the dock alone. I'm
            sorry.</p>

        <p>I wasn't one to share my feelings. Everyone knew me as closed-off. I was not someone who cried in hallways or
            had public breakdowns. There wasn't enough time in my schedule for that, and I had no interest in penciling
            "emotional collapse" into my planner. But my frustrations, my anger, my most secret interests, my thoughts,
            they spilled out to you so easily, even the ones about you. You saw the worst of my emotions, and I took
            advantage of your kindness to dump them on you. I'm sorry I hurt you. I was a bad friend. I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>My mind was a fortress of thoughts, walls, and relentless logic, but you flooded it until everything went
            blank like a cell shriveling up in a hypertonic solution. That's why I turned stupid around you, my logic
            just noped out. I thought love was supposed to be a loud, dramatic riot. But with you, it was the opposite.
            Every time I heard your voice, my world went quiet.</p>

        <p>I saw a reflection of my younger self in you, a version of me that was so much more vulnerable. I was trying
            to protect her, in a way that no one had ever protected me. It was never really about you. It was about
            saving a ghost. That was the seed of my obsession. But you were never that child. You possessed your own
            resilience. I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>[The following trial notes appear to have been ripped out and destroyed. Here is what remains of the page.]
        </p>

        <p>I used to hide in fictional worlds and silence my own anxieties. You taught me to do the opposite: to share
            my inner landscapes and speak my fears to my friends. You showed me how to be present in my own reality.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Observation:</h3>
        <div class="critical-alert">
            CRITICAL PROTOCOL BREACH: Subject is in a state of severe physiological and psychological distress. Data
            indicates a pathological fixation on the target, characterized by obsessive thought patterns, acute
            self-loathing, and a measurable degradation in logical reasoning. The subject's sleep-wake cycles are
            directly tethered to the target's attention, resulting in chronic sleep deprivation. Behavioral analysis
            confirms a dependency profile analogous to substance addiction, where the subject's emotional state is
            entirely contingent upon the target's validation. The subject demonstrates painful metacognitive awareness
            of their own compromised condition, yet exhibits a complete loss of agency to self-correct. The overall
            valence of the experience is overwhelmingly negative, defined by high-intensity psychological pain and a
            corrosive erosion of self-identity.
        </div>

        <ul class="observation-list">
            <li>Cognitive Dissonance (Extreme): Logs show violent oscillation between idealization ("I adored you") and
                devaluation ("You are poison").</li>
            <li>Systemic Dysregulation: Documented physiological (sleep deprivation, unexplained crying) and behavioral
                (decline in academic performance, social withdrawal) dysregulation.</li>
            <li>Loss of Agency: Subject explicitly describes a compromised will, stating an inability to think logically
                in the target's presence and a willingness to "rewrite my DNA for you."</li>
            <li>Compromised Self-Perception: A marked and sudden collapse in self-esteem is recorded, with the subject
                self-identifying as an "awful person" and a "hypocrite."</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="results">
            <strong>Results:</strong> The identified strain is pathogenic. The experiment is corrosive and
            unsustainable. The subject is being psychologically tortured. Experiment TERMINATED.
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The data is inconclusive. The operational definition of 'love' proves inconsistent across trials,
                rendering a singular diagnosis impossible. It is not a monolithic condition but a spectrum of reactive
                attachments, ranging from the formative bonds of friendship to a state of obsessive dysfunction. Trial 1
                established a foundational template: affection as a function of shared secrets and mutual vulnerability.
                Trial 2 demonstrated that devotion can be a stable, creative, and life-altering force. Trial 3, however,
                revealed the variable's latent toxicity, an attachment so consuming it dismantles the subject's logical
                framework and self-worth.</p>

            <p>The critical finding is that the emotion itself is not the primary indicator. The key variable is the
                self that is reflected back through the object of attachment. Does the connection reflect a self that is
                empowered, understood, and expanded, as in Trial 2? Or does it reflect a fractured, illogical, and
                diminished self, as in Trial 3?</p>

            <p><strong>Therefore, the core question is not "Am I in love with you?" but "What version of me does this
                    love create?" The most viable love is that which returns a reflection of a self the subject
                    recognizes, and, crucially, wishes to keep.</strong></p>
