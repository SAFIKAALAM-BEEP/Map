        <h1>High School</h1>

        <p>The same routine, a five-day cycle etched into muscle memory. The same path, a daily loop: up one concrete
            staircase, heading to the senior atrium. Then up two groaning escalators, passing my first class on the
            left, then up another flight of stairs to the math wing, their metal railings cold and familiar. A right
            turn, a walk to the end of a hallway lined with beige lockers and random stickers, before finally arriving
            at another classroom door. Only five minutes between bells to execute each traversal, a frantic interval
            that becomes a physics problem itself: Calculate the average velocity of a 60kg student moving 400 meters in
            4.5 minutes from gym on the 3rd floor to fifth-period physics on the 8th, accounting for friction from
            crowded hallways. My heart thumps a rhythm that has nothing to do with Newton's laws.</p>

        <p>In Geometry, we prove the congruence of rectangles, seeking perfect, logical certainty.</p>

        <p>A rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles. If a parallelogram is a rectangle, it has congruent
            diagonals. If a parallelogram has congruent diagonals, it is a rectangle.</p>

        <p>I see the same rigid patterns in the steel framework of the windows, a search for immutable truths in a world
            of shapes, while the social geometry of high school proves no theorem is ever that simple.</p>

        <pre><code>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></pre>

        <p>My mind feels like a fragmented hard drive, navigating the shortest path between classes like it's running
            Dijkstra's algorithm. It constantly updates the weights of crowded hallways and slow walkers, calculating
            the most efficient route to the next obligation, the optimal distribution of hours for studying. I don't
            hate it. I like the structure of school, the acquisition of knowledge like I'm building my own stats. But
            sometimes the mass of it all gets to me. The hours studying calculus, where integrals measure the area under
            the curve of change I can't control and derivatives trace the instantaneous rate of my own anxiety. The
            dense texts of World History outlining the fall of empires while I struggle to build a future. It all
            threatens to collapse on me like a dying star. I don't think I ever had a chance to catch myself, to stop
            and ask the fundamental question: what do I want to be? My body simply follows the repetitive motions, an
            automaton running a pre-written script.</p>

        <pre><code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax in 'self.define_future()'</code></pre>

        <blockquote>
            "What property of water makes ice float? What property makes your friends stick to you? Explain."
        </blockquote>

        <p>In Biology, we studied hydrogen bonds, a fragile architecture of attraction. In liquid, the molecules are a
            chaotic, dense dance party. In ice, they lock into a crystalline lattice, a grand, six-sided palace that
            forces them farther apart, making the solid less dense than the liquid. My table of friends is a human
            lattice in the cafeteria, our bonds of shared jokes and quiet understanding forming a structure so tight
            that the chaos of the crowded room simply can't penetrate. Adhesion and cohesion are the forces that make
            water stick to other molecules and to itself, respectively. I feel them when I'm stuck to my friends, a
            cohesive unit moving through the school's adhesive hallways.</p>

        <p>One of my friends goes on a huge, in-depth analysis of Shakespeare's King Lear, dissecting the folly of
            dividing a kingdom, a tragic failure in resource allocation and family dynamics. I listen, half-attentive, a
            little confused, my own mind still wrestling with the limit I failed to solve using L'Hôpital's rule on that
            calculus test. I purposefully pronounce it wrong: "Le hospital" just to bother the other math nerds. I
            wonder if Lear's "Nothing will come of nothing" is a bleak commentary on our own frantic pursuit of meaning
            in this place.</p>

        <pre><code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'existential_dread' and 'L'Hôpital'</code></pre>

        <p>In Architecture class, we learn about form and function, and I see the school not as a place of learning but
            as a brutalist structure designed for efficient human processing, its long, windowless hallways meant to
            minimize distraction and maximize movement, production. The architectural principle of load-bearing walls
            makes me wonder what parts of my own life are decorative and what structures are essential, holding
            everything up.</p>

        <pre><code>SystemExit: cannot escape the main thread</code></pre>

        <p>Sometimes, I don't work on my homework during my free time. I rebel against the algorithm. I sit on a cold,
            wooden bench which was donated by an alum, engraved with the inexplicable quote "BOOM BOOM," in the
            seventh-floor bio wing and stare at the "garden," a collection of potted trees and the deformed human clay
            sculptures the environmental club had set up. They are lumpy, misshapen skin-colored clay figures, and their
            features are blurred as if melting. They're kinda creepy, but I like them. They feel honest. Though if I
            told my friends that, they'd annoyingly start shipping me with them. Fucking children, these highschoolers.
        </p>

        <p>Other times, I am drawn to the first floor by the sound of a grand piano. A random student, someone I've
            never spoken to, is playing a meme song, but the acoustics make it sound like a grand ballad, their fingers
            moving with a certainty I envy. Others strum guitars "borrowed" from the music rooms, filling the tiled
            space with fleeting, beautiful noise. The music is unscripted, not for a grade, and it feels like the most
            authentic thing in the building.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, I just walk through the hallways aimlessly. In those moments, there are no thoughts of ionic
            bonds, Descartes, or causes of World War I. There is just me. There is the tap of my boots against the
            squeaky-clean floors, the sound of my own breaths, the slanted light through high windows, the muffled
            sounds of classes from behind closed doors. The unanalyzed fact of my body in this space. It is a silent,
            desperate act of reclaiming a sliver of time for a pure, unproductive being.</p>

        <p>There's so much I need to do for my goals, so much I need to learn. The path is a complex equation, a
            multi-variable calculus problem where the constants keep changing. The pressure is a constant mass, and the
            force of expectation makes it hard to breathe. It feels like being stuck on a plateau, the derivative of my
            progress flatlining. My days blend into weeks, a monotonous function where `f(t) = routine`. I feel so far
            away from what I need, from who I need to become.</p>

        <pre><code>ZeroDivisionError: division by zero ambition</code></pre>

        <p>But then, in a moment of quiet, I open a notebook and see the frantic scribbles from months ago. A calculus
            problem that was hieroglyphics now seems simple. The physics equations I can solve, the historical patterns
            I can recognize, and the code I can debug. I can now explain not just why ice floats, but how the hydrogen
            bonding in water is a cornerstone of life itself. I look at how far I've come, from simple cell diagrams to
            the complex relationships of an ecosystem. The progress, when viewed as a whole, is a function with a
            positive derivative. I am not at the limit yet. I am still converging, being shaped by this place's
            pressures and its strange, quiet beauties.</p>

        <p>The bell rings. The five-minute window opens. I get up from the bench, leaving the deformed sculptures to
            their silent congregation. The moment of feeling is over. The thinking must resume. I reenter the stream, a
            particle once more. The path ahead is long, the destination unknown, but the velocity is no longer zero. I
            am in motion. I am back inside the algorithm, but I am also learning its code. And sometimes, that has to be
            enough.</p>
